        <p>
            I tend to bake when I need something to do that keeps me busy and helps
            to work off stress. It is nice to listen to a podcast, do the methodical
            tasks of ingredient prep and mixing, and appear to be doing something
            busy and important so that the kids ask dad for help instead of me for a
            while! It helps if they want to eat the end results. And I don't mind
            the bonus of having a treat at the end, either!
        </p>
