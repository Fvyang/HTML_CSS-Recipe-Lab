            <li>Pour the canola/peanut oil into the pot/frying pan and heat it to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                This step will allow time for the chicken to soak in with the buttermilk and batter.
            </li>
            <li>Carefully lower the coated chicken pieces into the pot/pan. All pieces should be
                fully submerged and spaced apart in frying oil.

                alt="submerging coated chicken into frying oil." width="460px">
            <li>Let the chicken cook untouched for about 10 minutes (for wings, drummies) or 12 minutes (for legs,
                thighs,
                breasts). Ensure the oil temperature is maintained, as the inserted chicken will lower it.</li>
            <li>Once skin is deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken
                registers at 165Â°, take them out and place them into a serving plate. Repeat steps 6-8 with additional
                batches until all finished.</li>
            <li>Let the chicken cool off for 5 minutes, serve, and enjoy all the flavorful, moist, crispy, goodness
                these
                glorious wings have to offer.</li>

    <p>And there you have it. You've successfully created some of the most delicious fried chicken on earth. Feel free
        to adjust the spices, as well as the ratio of the batter mix (for example, 75% corn starch & 25% flour for more
        crispness) to your linking. Also, you can skip the brining to save prep time, though you may sacrafice some
        moistness and flavor of the chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks for following along, and I wish you all the best in your cooking journey and beyond.
